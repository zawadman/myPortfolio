# myPortfolio

This repository contains the source for my personal portfolio website.
The site is built with a single `index.html` page that uses Bootstrap
for layout and styling. All images used in the page can be found in the
`assets/images` directory.

## Getting started

To view the site locally, clone the repository and open `index.html` in
your web browser. The page is completely static and requires no build
step. You can also host it with any static site provider such as GitHub
Pages.

Feel free to explore the HTML for examples of how to create project
cards, about sections and contact links.
